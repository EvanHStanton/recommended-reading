Data science-based literature.

A couple of points for your consideration:
1. Please support the authors when you can. If they have elevated you in somee way, try to lift them up as well.
2. Programming languages are not mutually exclusive. In other words, submissions in the r-based section may be helpful for non-r users, e.g., the publication on data organization:
- Wickham, H. . (2014). Tidy Data. Journal of Statistical Software, 59(10), 1â€“23. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10
